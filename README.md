# Altkamul-Assessment-
Build a simple app to hit the NY Times Most Popular Articles API and show a list of articles, that shows details when items on the list are tapped (a typical master/detail app). There will be Voice Recognition, so when User Says “Load Data” then API will be called and Articles List will appear on Screen.  We'll be using the most viewed section of this API.  http://api.nytimes.com/svc/mostpopular/v2/mostviewed/{section}/{period}.json?api-key=sample-key
